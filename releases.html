<h3>RobustIRC v0.1 (2015-03-12)</h3>

<p>
<i class="fa fa-github"></i> <a href="https://github.com/robustirc/robustirc/releases/tag/v0.1">GitHub tag</a>
<i class="fa fa-docker"></i> <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/robustirc/robustirc/">Docker container</a>
</p>

<p>
This is the first public release of RobustIRC. It has been used for a number of
weeks with (by now) more than 30 users. That said, since it is the first
release, there are probably a couple of rough edges.
</p>

<p>
A known weakness of this version is compaction not being completely implemented
for all IRC commands: if you let this version of RobustIRC run for too long, it
will eventually run out of memory/disk. We are talking about many weeks
here, but itâ€™s important to be aware of it. When using this version, we
strongly recommend you upgrade to newer versions soon.
